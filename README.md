# hello! ðŸ‘‹
i'm czctus! i've been programming since 2020.
typically i don't upload public projects, but the ones i do will be visible here.

i use a few programming languages:
### javascript (node.js specifically)
experience: 2 years (mid-level developer)
i've worked on several api's, discord bots, and various misc projects.
i use typescript in most of my recent projects, but im still not great at it.

### lua/luau 
experience: 5 years (senior developer)
i am highly familiar with the language, working on several modules and games.
i have made myself extremely familiar with the type system.

### csharp
experience: 1 year (mid-level developer)
i don't really do much with this language, only working with .NET, however its a language i could work with if i need to.

<!--
```js
process.stdout.write("And I love programming!"); // mostly
```
